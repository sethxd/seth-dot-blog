Other than not writing anything new for this blog, am I right?

Life has been busy.

Part of my motivation for building this blog was playing around with tailwindcss, and then I started a massive work project using tailwind, so that itch has been effectively scratched.

## Work stuff

Yes, so I've been building a Wordpress theme from scratch(ish) for the very first time, and using tailwind for that. I started with the amazing [_tw](https://underscoretw.com/) and took off running. It's been a great learning experience, and I feel more confident with Wordpress now. My favorite tailwind features are the conditional modifiers. Using these to set hover states or multiple breakpoint configurations with just a few more classes feels like cheating.

## Fun stuff

I finally "hacked" my Playstation Vita so I can take advantage of all the fun homebrew utilities and turn it into a sweet little portable emulation machine. The homebrew community around the Vita is surprisingly active for a "dead" console. Feels a lot better to use a $30 256gb microSD card for storage than pay double the price for a quarter of the storage with Sony's proprietary cards.

## Life stuff

My son, Oleander, will be seven months old in a few days. He's changing and growing constantly, and it's fascinating to watch.
