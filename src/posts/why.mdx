This just keeps happening to me.

[The first blog I built used Jekyll and free hosting through Github Pages.](https://github.com/sethxd/sethxd.github.io) That worked well enough, but I remember right I was using some custom gems and had to build everything locally, then push it live. More friction than I wanted. And I didn't have any other Ruby experience and wasn't looking to use it for anything else, so I was essentially acquiring useless experience.

My next blog a few years later used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for the frontend, and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) for the backend. I used Netlify to host the published site, and a Digital Ocean droplet for my Ghost instance. I had a bunch of extra maintenance with this just trying to keep my Ghost instance updated and functional. I really like the look and feel of Ghost as a CMS but definitely feels like all the new feature development is focused on subscriptions, newsletters, monetization etc. And I just need basic blog platform.

So this iteration of the blog is using Gatsby for the frontend and straight up markdown files for the posts. Keeping it simple. I started building this because I'm continually trying to learn and get better with React and I also wanted a playground to start learning Tailwind. This is as much a lab for me as it is a writing platform.

```javascript
// Testing this Prismic plugin here
console.log('Hello, world.')
  ```

I followed [this guide](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-gatsby-with-tailwind-css-a-tutorial-with-examples/) to start my Gatsby site and install Tailwind. So I've been messing around with Tailwind, getting some plugins installed, and figuring out some of the under-the-hood fun. Worked on the grid display and some conditional styling depending on if posts have a featured image in their frontmatter or not.

## Next steps

- Add additional styles to Markdown content, the Tailwind reset makes it pretty bare bones.
- More tailored responsive styling
- Create more pages (About, tag pages, related posts?)
- Switch to MDX?

For the moment I'm going to stop fiddling and just get something online.
